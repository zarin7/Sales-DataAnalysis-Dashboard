# Project Overview
## What I Did:

-Data Collection & Cleaning: Imported raw Excel files, removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data using Power Query.

-Data Modeling: Linked multiple tables (Sales, Products, Customers) using Data Model for better relationship management.

## Analysis & KPIs:

-How can we analyze sales and profit data to identify key performance metrics, customer trends, and top-performing products to drive data-driven business decisions?

-Which year recorded the peak sales volume across all quarters?

-Which age group contributed the most to sales performance?

-How did male vs female customers compare in terms of sales volume?

-Which product categories received the maximum number of orders?

## Insights & Recommendations:

-Old Age Group (51-100) contributed the highest sales volume among all gender groups.

-Male vs Female sales performance was quite balanced (49% vs 51%).
